This python program will estimate the value of Pi by randomly selecting
points inside a 2 x 2 square, which has an area of 4) and then determines
if the points are inside the inscribed circle (area of Pi). The program
keeps track of the percentage of the points inside the circle and then
multiplies that by 4 (the area of the square).  As the number of points
increases, the result should get closer to Pi ðŸ¤“
